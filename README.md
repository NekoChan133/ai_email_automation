# ai_email_automation
This is a complete, full-scale project called "AI-Enhanced Email Outreach Automation" that uses Python together with an AI content generator (using OpenAI’s API) to automatically create and send personalized email campaigns. You can use and extend this project as part of an internship program for Blindspot.
In this project, the application will:
    
Generate personalized email content:
It uses an AI agent (via the OpenAI API) to produce a tailored email message based on a given offer and recipient information.
    
Send emails to recipients:
It uses Python’s built-in email libraries (or can be extended to use a third-party email service) to dispatch emails automatically.
    
Schedule periodic campaigns:
A scheduler (using the APScheduler library) will trigger the email sending process at regular intervals.

To install the libraries run: pip install -r requirements.txt
And then you can run the app by runing the main.py file
